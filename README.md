# Logan's Gear Shop
This is my first project made utilizing .Net Core. In the project I build upon .Net Core base functionality, utizling a local sql server to store product details for the mock shop. Those are then displayed on the user interface via MVC functionality. The UI is created utilizing bootstrap 4 and custom css as needed.
